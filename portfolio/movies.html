    <h1>The best movies I have ever seen</h1>
    <h2>Top 3</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>The Notebook(2004)</h3>
    <p>An elderly man reads to a woman with dementia the story of two young lovers whose romance is threatened by the difference in their respective social classes.</p>
    <h3>Flipped(2010)</h3>
    <p>Two eighth-graders start to have feelings for each other despite being total opposites.</p>
    <h3>Singin' in the Rain(1952)</h3>
    <p>Its trio of dancers—rubber-faced (and heeled) Donald O’Connor, sparkling newcomer Debbie Reynolds and co-director and headline act Gene Kelly—are a triple threat, nailing the stellar songs, intricate and physically demanding dance routines and selling all the comic beats with consummate skill.</p>
